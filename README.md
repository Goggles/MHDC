A Monster Hunter Freedom Unite damage calculator
------------------------------------------------

This is intended to replace the scripts hosted on reign-of-the-rathalos.com, which closed down over the summer of 2012. The site owner never released the scripts, and probably never will.

There will also be improvements - an account system to log in and keep profiles of frequently used weapons, the ability to check up to four weapons against one monster.

Original features will be kept, with modifications - such as as well as a top list of recommended weapons, also recommendations from saved profiles of weaponry.

Formulas for 3rd gen(Tri, Portable 3rd etc) will be added in the future.

### Changelog

* Version 0.2
  * All three basic formulas for Freedom Unite are now implemented.
* Version 0.1.5
  * Implementation of the bow damage formula (Incomplete, needs support for multiple arrows)
* Version 0.1
  * Implementation of the melee damage formulas
